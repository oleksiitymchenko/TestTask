# TestTask
- We need to build a feature to allow authenticated users to like/unlike pages on our site. 
- Each page should display the "total likes" count for this page at the bottom. 
- Only authenticated users should be able to click the like/unlike button to mark their interest in the page. 
- If a user has already liked the current page, the like button should display the text ‘unlike’. 
- If a user hasn’t already liked the current page, the button should display the text ‘like’.  

Project should be created using ASP.NET MVC and contains at least 5 different pages.  
You can fill every page with any lorem ipsum text, moreover, please don't care about styles/CSS.  
Auth, database/memory - choose any approach you would like.
